## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Discord bot token** from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. **PostgreSQL** database — hosted or local. Avoid anything that meters
   _compute time_ rather than resources: the bot holds a connection around the
   clock, so a serverless database never gets the idle stretch it needs to
   suspend, and the monthly allowance goes on simply being up. Aiven and
   Supabase bill for size instead, which suits this workload
3. **Bun** runtime

The bot also needs the **View Audit Log** permission. Without it kicks, bans and
timeouts are still logged, but with no moderator or reason attached.

### Getting started

1. Duplicate `.env.example` as `.env` and fill it in.

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   bun install
   ```

3. Start it:

   ```sh
   bun run dev
   ```

   Migrations run automatically on boot and are awaited before the bot logs in,
   so a fresh database builds itself. There is no separate migration step.

4. Run `!verify-users` in Discord to populate member data. The background queue
   only updates members who trigger an event, so existing quiet members stay
   empty until this full sync runs.

### Health checks

The bot serves two endpoints on port 4000 (`HEALTH_PORT` to change):

| Endpoint        | Purpose                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/health`       | Liveness. Touches nothing external, so it is cheap to poll.              |
| `/health/ready` | Readiness. Adds a database round trip — for deploy checks, not monitors. |

Both answer `503` rather than `200` when the Discord gateway is down: a bot that
cannot receive a message is not healthy, and a monitor checking only for a
response would never notice.

## Commands

### Public

| Command        | Description                                            | Options                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `/stats`       | Server and member statistics                           | `type`, `user`, `lookback` |
| `/warnings`    | Your warnings — or another member's, with Manage Roles | `user`, `page` (optional)  |
| `/report`      | Report a member to the moderators                      | `user`, `reason`           |
| `/time`        | Current time around the world, or one place            | `location` (optional)      |
| `/lookback-me` | Change your own lookback range                         | `lookback`                 |

`/stats` takes a `type` of `me`, `member`, `top` or `members`. `user` applies
only to `member` and `lookback` only to `top` — Discord cannot tie an option to
one choice, so both are always offered and validated when the command runs.

### Moderator (Manage Roles)

| `/status`          | Bot CPU and memory                               |                                              |
| `!verify-users`    | Full member resync (prefix command)              |                                              |

### Administrator

| Command              | Description                                | Options                    |

| `/delete-member-db`  | Remove a member from the database          | `user`                     |
| `/audit-roles`       | Audit roles for elevated permissions       |                            |
| `/troll-move-user`   | Move a member between empty voice channels | `user`, `count`, `timeout` |

`defaultMemberPermissions` is only a default. Discord lets you override any
command per role under **Server Settings → Integrations → bibi → Command
Permissions**, which is the better place to tune access — it takes effect
immediately and needs no redeploy.

### Levels and message history

Levels count rows in `MemberMessages`, which the bot writes as it sees messages
arrive — so on a server that existed before the bot did, everyone starts at
zero however long they have been talking.

`!backfill-messages` imports the backlog once, reading every channel the bot
can see and storing each message's real send time so lookback windows and the
member-flow chart stay accurate. It stores metadata only, never content. Bot
messages and empty messages are skipped.

Progress is saved every few hundred messages, including a cursor into the
channel being read, so a run interrupted by a restart resumes from roughly
where it stopped rather than starting that channel again. Pass `--reset` to
start from the beginning instead.

## Moderation behaviour

**Filters stop at the first one that acts.** AI spam, duplicate spam and the
invite filter run in that order; whichever acts first deletes the message and
returns, so a single message cannot be punished twice or banked as XP.

**Exemptions are one concept.** `SPAM_EXEMPT_CHANNELS` and `SPAM_EXEMPT_ROLES`
skip every filter, including the invite filter and message edits.

**Jailing follows Discord's own hierarchy.** `/jail` refuses a target whose
highest role is equal to or above the moderator's, so a moderator cannot jail
an administrator, a peer, or themselves — the server owner is exempt. It also
refuses anyone the bot cannot manage, because a jail that cannot strip their
roles leaves them holding both the jail role and everything else.

**Staff are warned but never auto-punished.** Anyone holding a `STAFF_ROLES`
role still gets warnings recorded, but the bot will never jail them or delete
their messages on its own. Moderators can still act on them by hand.

**Jailing protects some channels, and protects more of them for established
members.** Jailing otherwise deletes the member's last 14 days of messages in
every channel, and none of it comes back.

| List                     | Applies to                                         |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `DELETE_NEVER_CHANNELS`  | Everyone. Never swept.                             |
| `DELETE_EXEMPT_CHANNELS` | Only members holding a `DELETE_EXEMPT_ROLES` role. |

So a long-standing member keeps their contributions to the channels that
matter, while a raider holding nothing but the base member role has everything
removed. Leaving `DELETE_EXEMPT_ROLES` empty applies the exemption to everyone.

Both lists match a channel name **or a category name**, threads inherit their
parent's protection, and a thread the member owns inside a protected channel is
kept rather than deleted. Discord's own system messages — join notices, boosts,
pins — are never deleted anywhere; they carry the member as their author but
removing them only leaves holes in the server's record.

The role is read **before** the jail is applied, because applying it strips
every other role the member holds — asking afterwards would find no OG role on
anyone.

`STAFF_ROLES` does **not** grant this automatically. Staff are already never
auto-jailed, but a moderator can still jail a colleague by hand, and that path
is deliberately exempt from the staff guard — so list the staff roles in
`DELETE_EXEMPT_ROLES` too if you want their history to survive that. The boot
check reports any name in either list that matches no role.

**Jailing someone already jailed is refused.** It cannot punish them further,
and its sweep would delete the protected channels the first jail spared — by
then they hold no exempt role for it to match. `/jail` reports this instead of
acting; unjail first if you need to widen the deletion window. The automated
filters stop at the same point.

**Warnings have one source of truth.** `MemberWarning` rows are authoritative;
`memberGuild.warnings` is a derived counter kept in sync from them.

## Logging

Moderation actions go to `MOD_LOG_CHANNELS` and are written to the `ModLog`
table — the row is the record, the embed is a best-effort mirror. Kicks, bans,
unbans and timeouts are attributed via the audit log, as are jails applied by
handing someone the jail role directly rather than running `/jail`.

Ambient events — joins, leaves, nickname changes, message edits and deletions —
go to `SERVER_LOG_CHANNELS` (falling back to `JOIN_EVENT_CHANNELS`) and are
**not** stored, deliberately.

`LOG_EXEMPT_CHANNELS` excludes channels from that ambient logging, matching a
channel name **or a category name** — naming a staff category covers every
channel inside it, including ones added later. Deleted messages from exempt
channels are not stored either, so they cannot be retrieved with `/logs deleted`.

## Configuration

Everything lives in your environment file; see `.env.example` for the full list.
The ones worth knowing:

| Variable                     | Effect when unset                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GUILD_ID`                   | Required. Comma-separated for multiple servers.          |
| `STATUS_ROLES`               | Needs a `jail` entry or jailing silently does nothing.   |
| `STAFF_ROLES`                | No staff exemption from automated punishment.            |
| `LOG_EXEMPT_CHANNELS`        | Everything is logged, staff channels included.           |
| `DELETE_EXEMPT_CHANNELS`     | Jailing sweeps every channel, announcements included.    |
| `DELETE_EXEMPT_ROLES`        | The exemption above applies to everyone, not just OGs.   |
| `DELETE_NEVER_CHANNELS`      | No channel is protected unconditionally.                 |
| `BACKGROUND_WORKERS_ENABLED` | Defaults on. `false` stops member data ever updating.    |
| `TEMPLATE_VALIDATION_BOARDS` | Empty = off. Enables AI template checks on forum boards. |
| `PRIVILEGED_INTENTS_ENABLED` | Defaults on. `false` runs in limited mode, filters off.  |

Role and channel names are matched **exactly**. On boot the bot checks each
configured name against every guild and reports what does not resolve — worth
reading, because a name that does not match fails silently otherwise.
